perl Makefile.PL && make
should install required perl modules for CiderWebmail.

Run script/ciderwebmail_server.pl to test the application.

The user running the application (e.g. wwwrun) needs write access to the root/var directory. 

The path to the user_settings.sql file can be configured by adding something like the following to ciderwebmail.yml. This is needed for example when deploying using mod_perl:

Model::DB:
    connect_info:
        - 'dbi:SQLite:/srv/www/cgi-bin/CiderWebmail/root/var/user_settings.sql'

Please have a look at http://wiki.catalystframework.org/wiki/deployment for further information about deployment on a web server.
